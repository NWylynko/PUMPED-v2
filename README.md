## First Setup

1. `yarn install` to install dependencies
2. `docker-compose up` to bring up the database
3. `yarn push-schema` to push the schema to the database
4. `yarn generate-types:watch` to generate the types and functions
5. `yarn dev` to bring up next.js

You will have 3 terminal windows open, 4 if you want to run `typecheck:watch` to
watch for type errors
